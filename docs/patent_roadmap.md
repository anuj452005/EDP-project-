# 🇮🇳 Patent Roadmap: AI Plant Disease Detection System

This document outlines the strategy and requirements for filing a patent in India for the **Plant Disease Detection & Severity Estimation System**.

## 1. Navigating Section 3(k) (Computer-related Inventions)
In India, "computer programs per se or algorithms" are not patentable under Section 3(k) of the Patents Act, 1970. To succeed, we must prove a **"Technical Effect"**.

### Strategy:
- **Focus on the System:** Don't just patent the code. Patent the *system* that integrates image capturing, AI processing, and real-time agricultural action (precision spraying).
- **Technical Contribution:** Emphasize how the system solves a technical problem: "Reducing chemical wastage through precision severity-based dosage calculation."
- **Tangible Outcome:** The output isn't just a label; it's a specific chemical recommendation (dosage) that interacts with physical agricultural management.

## 2. Patent Filing Process (DPIIT Startup Route)
As a startup/individual, you are eligible for **80% fee concessions** and **Expedited Examination**.

### Step-by-Step Filing:
1. **Invention Disclosure:** Prepare the technical architecture.
2. **Novelty Search:** Verify no similar "severity-based precision dosage" system exists.
3. **Form 1 (Application):** Basic details of the applicant and inventor.
4. **Form 2 (Specification):** The core document. Use the "Complete Specification" once the system is fully developed.
5. **Form 18A (Expedited Examination):** Highly recommended for startups to get a grant within 1-1.5 years.

## 3. Required Forms & Fees (Estimated)
| Stage | Form Number | Fee (Startup/Individual) |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Filing | Form 1 & 2 | ₹1,600 |
| Statement on Foreign Filing | Form 3 | ₹0 |
| Declaration of Inventorship | Form 5 | ₹0 |
| Expedited Examination | Form 18A | ₹8,000 |
| **Total Govt Fees** | — | **₹9,600** |

## 4. Drafting Outline for "Technical Specification"
- **Field of Invention:** Precision Agriculture & AI.
- **Background:** Highlighting the inefficiency of blanket pesticide spraying.
- **Summary:** An AI system that calculates specific dosages based on leaf-level severity segmentation.
- **Detailed Description:** Use the model architecture (YOLOv8 + MobileNetV2 + Segment-to-Dosage logic).
- **Claims:** Focus on the "method of calculating pesticide dosage based on segmented lesion area."

## 5. Important Deadlines
- **Publication:** Usually 18 months (request early publication to speed up).
- **Response to FER:** You must respond to the First Examination Report within 6 months of issuance.

---
> [!TIP]
> **Provisional Patent:** If the system is still evolving, file a "Provisional Specification" first. This gives you a **Priority Date** and 12 months to file the "Complete Specification."
